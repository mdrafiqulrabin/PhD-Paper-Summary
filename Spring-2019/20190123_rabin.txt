[1] Problem:

Compiler should be correct because silently miscompilation may cause serious damage in safety-critical software.
Understanding compiler bugs are very important because they can help to detect and fix compilers bug.
For this reason, authors conduct an empirical study on the characteristics of the bugs in GCC and LLVM.
This study shows that even mature production compilers may trigger many bugs and it also highlights various kinds of interesting characteristics of bugs.
This study will guide developers towards the challenges and opportunities to more effectively test and debug compilers.

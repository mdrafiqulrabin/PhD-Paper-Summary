[1] Problem:

In safety-critical applications, the tools should be more acute and fulfill its function.
Various certification standards are used to measure the quality of the tools.
The compiler and the static analyzer could be on the same formalization of the programming language.
But an early adopter can change any of them without changing both of them.
So, the key challenge is to ensure the static analyzer being proposed agrees with the compiler already in use.
Authors' partial solution is to apply automated random testing on the compiler and the analyzer.
In this paper, the Csmith generated random programs were used to test the Farma-C Static Analyzer.

[2] Solution:

Frama-C is a framework for analysis and transformation of C programs.
Csmith is an automatic generator of random C programs for differential testing of compilers.

Authors used Csmith to test Frama-C. The steps are followings:
  - Generate random C programs by Csmith. 
  - Define several oracles for those deterministic programs.
  - Check whether Frama-C wrongly handled a generated program.
    
[3] Evaluation:

Authors performed the evaluation on the value analysis or plug-ins of Frama-C:
    - Robustness Testing: Uncover crash bugs if doesn't terminate normally.
    - Value Analysis as C Interpreter: Check the result of Frama-C interpreter with the result of a reference compiler (GCC/Clang).
    - Printing Internal Invariants in Executable C Form: Analyze and obtain an assertion that holds before termination.
    - Constant Propagation: Compare results by replacing the single input expressions with the corresponding value.
    - Slicing: Compare results by removing everything that does not contribute to the user-defined criterion.
    
The result of the evaluation:
- 50 bugs were found in the front-end (AST elaboration and type-checking) and in the value analysis, constant propagation and slicing plug-ins.
- Several undefined bugs were also found by Frama-C in Csmith (dangling pointers, unsequenced assignments to the same memory location, access uninitialized members of unions).

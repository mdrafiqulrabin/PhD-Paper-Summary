[1] Problem:

Recent advances in NLP introduce a new area of research called deep adversarial learning (AdvL). In recent years this 
area has gained a significant amount of attractions after the publication of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
Therefore, deep adversarial learning methods should be introduced to the researchers without any prior knowledge. 
Authors in this article aim to support that with a tutorial. They represent the applications of adversarial learning 
in different NLP problems with different examples.

[2] Solution:

Researchers already have taken some steps to adversarial learning that could be sectioned into three core parts: 
(1) Adversarial Example: creating or learning adversarial examples to improve the NLP system, (2) Adversarial Training: 
adding noise, randomness, etc loss parameters during optimization, and (3) Adversarial Training: including practical 
solutions of GANs for processing natural languages. Authors design the tutorial in three parts: (I) Introduction to deep 
adversarial learning with various application in NLP, (II) Generation of deep adversarial examples and uses in  NLP, 
and (III) A case study of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for NLP.

[3] Evaluation:

Authors focus on the related subject of Natural Language Processing: Noise-Robust Representation Learning, Adversarial
Learning, and Generation. This tutorial is organized in three parts: Foundations of Deep Adversarial Learning, Adversarial
Examples for NLP, and An In-depth Case Study of GANs in NLP. The recent studies of AdvL include: Deep Reinforcement Learning
for NLP, Scalable Construction and Reasoning of Massive Knowledge Bases, Questioning Question Answering Answers, Teaching a
Machine to Converse, Local, Model-Agnostic Explanations of machine Learning Predictions, etc.

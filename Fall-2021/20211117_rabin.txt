- Your prior experience writing a paper:

Before I didnâ€™t have good knowledge on writing Introduction and Related Works. Now I have enough knowledge to lead the writing of the Introduction section. Also, my writing for related works has improved significantly.



- What 1-2 ideas/techniques helped you improve your writing:
 
Introduction: The idea of directly stating the problem, and why it is important, interesting and hard is very useful to clearly demonstrate the goal of the paper in the introduction.

Related Works: During writing the related works, pointing out the strength and weakness of previous works and contrasting our work with them.



- What 1-2 ideas/techniques did not help as much as you would have liked:
 
Describe Results: I still need to improve my skills on describing result sections. I feel like I am not good at selecting key research questions from my experiments and results.

Diagram, Algorithm, Equation: Sometimes I have difficulties drawing workflow, algorithm, and equations.
 
 
 
- Overall how do you rate your writing skills:
 
I need to improve my writing, especially to draw diagrams and describe result sections, and choosing key terms and rich vocabulary to improve my writing. However, I have enough knowledge from this course and I will follow that to improve my writing.
